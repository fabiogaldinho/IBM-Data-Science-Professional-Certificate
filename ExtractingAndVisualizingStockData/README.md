# **EXTRACTING AND VISUALIZING STOCK DATA**

This is a public repository containing the notebook for the final assignment for the [Python for Data Science, AI & Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai) course on the Coursera platform.

This is part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).

The assignment was to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting the data I had to visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns and trends. The stocks I worked with was Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
